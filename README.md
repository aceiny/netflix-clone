this website is not yet finished but so far i've learned so much
in the login page it checks the password and email are valid if not it shows the yeelow errour message 
in th signup first page it checks the email and shows an errour depending on if the email length is "< 4" it shows erreur  and if the email length is > 4 and is not valid it shows another erreur and you cant click the get started button until the email is valid ,
in the other signup page it checks the email and the password and you cant procede to another step unless the email and the password are correct when choosing plan type i added all the feature on the netflix chossing plan type you can add another plan and give it name , price , gradiant color and btn colors when you click on it 
the main isnt yet completed i felt bored maybe i'll do it latter 
the website  is responsive for the big part
